# Our Core Team

We are an international team comprised 5 core members. Our core team members live in USA, South Africa, Brazil and Switzerland. We are an anonymous team due to multiple reasons. We do not plan to publicly dox ourselves, but will consider in the future. We think that through our actions, we have already proven to our community and supporters that we are good actors in this space and will continue to be.

## <mark style="color:green;">Enebula</mark>

<mark style="color:green;">**Founder**</mark> - Education in web development. Experience in web design, sales, customer service relations and previous career in Industrial Combustion Technologies, Industrial Maintenance and Industrial Maintenance Supervisor.&#x20;

Enebula created The Rugpull Prevention project on May 15, 2021 after seeing a need for the community to come together in a place to speak about the safety of Avalanche projects. It quickly became apparent that the project was needed and we could make a real difference. This is when the plan to automate DeFi safety began to form. Enebula was able to form up with two incredible team members in July and have been working together on the project ever since. With a long term vision and a focus on community, the Rugpull Prevention project is still just beginning it's journey to become a fully automated DeFi safety community.

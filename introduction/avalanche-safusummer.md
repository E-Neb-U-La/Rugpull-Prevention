### <mark style="color:green;">Our Importance to the Network</mark>

From the beginning, Rugpull Prevention has been an honest and dependable source of DeFi safety. We have helped to spread awareness and knowledge with the help of the many incredible developers around the network. We have become a place that devs come together and contribute. We believe we have already influenced many others to know the risks of DeFi and have encouraged them to share what they have learned.&#x20;

With time comes experience and trust, but we know that centralized trust is not the future. Part of why Rugpull Prevention is so important is because we are not just a project, we are the Avalanche Community, native and exclusive to the network.

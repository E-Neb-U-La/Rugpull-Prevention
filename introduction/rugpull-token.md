### <mark style="color:green;">Token Description</mark>

The RUGPULL token is a deflationary digital token which is used as a tool to become part of a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO). The token is directly used to buy community utility NFTs, which burns 75% of every transaction.

Now that our Detective's Guild is launched, we have focused on developing DeFi safety tools. We have a very specific toolset and plan in place. More news will be released about these tools soon #SafuSummer



### <mark style="color:green;">Token History</mark>

Without the RUGPULL token, Rugpull Prevention would not exist. The founder burned and locked liquidities, strategically locked up tokens to incentivize development and project growth, also initiating ways to create use cases.&#x20;

The RUGPULL token has a very unique beginning. The team did not create the token. The token was created by a semi - anonymous developer and deployed. After communicating with the person that created the contract through Telegram (see message history in official telegram) to get the contract verified and ownership renounced, we decided we could fully adopt the token and use it for our blockchain needs. We will continue to add more utility to the Rugpull token offering ways to access our premium anti-scam tools.&#x20;

There is no ownership of the RUGPULL token, the contract can never be changed and no more can ever be created. The locked liquidity insures that there cannot ever be a Rugpull of liquidities and the supply is deteriorating while use cases will grow.&#x20;

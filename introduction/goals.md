# Goals

### <mark style="color:green;">Mission Statement</mark>

We want to bring value to the community with ethical and honest standards, educating our community through transparency, tools and awareness. We want to change the cryptocurrency culture, making it about community, tech and unity rather than greed and deception. As we grow, we want to focus more marketing efforts towards traditional markets as we hope to be the first stop for new crypto users after onboarding.

### <mark style="color:green;">Roadmap Goals</mark>

* Expand our "Know Your Developers" KYD process and our "NFTrust" process eventually allowing for automation through the use of the RUGPULL token. <mark style="color:orange;">(Put on hold until after tools deployed)</mark>
* Deploy a Deflationary Staking Dapp that will reward our value-less community utility token (TDG). <mark style="color:green;">(Completed)</mark>

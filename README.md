# Rugpull Prevention Whitepaper

We are the first defense in an industry full of fraud. Together, we can change the culture of crypto for the better. We provide transparency, confidence and tools to help you when others are trying to take as much from you as they can. We do not give financial advice. Your decisions are your own.&#x20;

The information we provide should not be considered financial advice. We provide transparency through multiple forms of communications.&#x20;

We are also building a Decentralized Autonomous Organization that will be an automated "Safety Net" for the Avalanche Network.&#x20;

The Rugpull Prevention project is a long term community project that focuses on the community first. Please join us in our fight against scams!

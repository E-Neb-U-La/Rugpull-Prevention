Rugpull Prevention is a community project that is building on the Avalanche Network.  
We will offer custom DeFi safety tools, on chain voting for community detective scores, and allow proposals from the community. 
Our vision is to create an open source platform that anyone can build upon to create easy to use tools for DeFi.

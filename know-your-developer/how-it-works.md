# How it Works

Our KYD process is a multi-layered transparency service that we offer to Avalanche Network projects. We work closely with other project teams to provide deep dive research in an easy to understand way, with a focus on DeFi Safety. KYD is not a project audit. KYD is not financial advice, please be aware that all of your financial decisions are your own.&#x20;

# How to Acquire TDG Community Tokens

To use the staking Dapp you will need an official Rugpull Prevention NFT. You can buy one [here](https://rugpullnfts.web.app/) with RUGPULL tokens and a small amount of Avax for gas fees. Please make sure that you have Metamask installed and you are connected to the Avalanche Network.

After you buy the NFT, you will need to go to our staking Dapp [here](https://rugpullnfts.web.app/staking) <mark style="color:red;"></mark> Next, you will need to stake your NFT into the Dapp. With our Dapp, you will be able to see what NFTs you have available to stake and what NFTs you have staking.&#x20;

In return for staking, you will receive the token "TDG" (which stands for TheDetectivesGuild), once you have 25,000 TDG tokens in your wallet, you will be able to unlock our tool "MetaDetect"! This will allow you to vote, rate, comment and apply for new project listings!

If you hold 12,500 TDG tokens, you can join our verified detectives area in our discord! There you can help us investigate possible scams, it's also a great place to be to learn more about how you can get scammed!
